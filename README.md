# Image Recognition Project

This is a webapp where visitors can play one of two games relating to image recognition of the [CIFAR-100 data set](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The CIFAR-100 data set contains 60000 32x32 colored images, 10000 of which are used for the games (the other 50000 images were used to train the model).

In the first game mode, Man vs. Machine, players classify images against a convolutional neural network that was designed using the Keras API.

In the second game mode, Blitz, players classify as many images as they can within 30 seconds.
